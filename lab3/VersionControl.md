# Version Control

## Task 1: Understanding Version Control Systems

Version control systems this is the software which track and manage the changes in the files. They help developers to work simultaneously on the same product increasing productivity and lessen the number of errors. The main benefit that developers can work on the same code keep and commit all the changes they have full control on their code, able to fix mistakes restore previous changes, merge different versions etc. And all of this could be done without interfering other developers in the team.

There are 2 types of VCS:

- Centralized - developers work and commit on central repository which is only one source of truth. Usually files are locken when user works on it to prevent concurrent modifications.
- Distributed - developers can have their own local of repository and after that they can push the changes to remote repositry and merge it to remote repository.

The most popular VCS for now:

1. Git - it is a distirbuted VCS in my opinion this is the most popular VCS for now.
2. Subversion - centralized VCS it was used in past but still could be used by companies who have legacy project or prefer centraluzed approach in version control.
3. Mercurial - distirbuted VCS similar to Git but in the same time it is more simple to use. Git for now has bigger community with a lot of learning resources.
