# Software Distribution

## Task 1: Research Software Distribution Strategies


1. Software distribution is the process of delivering software applications or updates to end-users. It is a crucial to each company to deliver the software to it's users, since this is their main source of revenue.
There are a lot of types of distribution:

- physical media distribution (seems outdated now) it is when you go and buy cd/dvd whatever and then install it to your machine
- online downloads from websites - donwload executabel file from official site of the application
- app stores - special application, usually for mobile device, where you can buy/download for free various applications.
- package managers - in my opinion mostly used by developers while creating some software product
- cloud based deployment - usually software as a service deployed in a cloud which resoursces could be used by other users.

The best practices to deliver hiqh qulaity software to the users:

- version control
- release management
- analyze user feedback
- high security
- clear documentation and support 24/7
- automatin and CI/CD with frequent changes
