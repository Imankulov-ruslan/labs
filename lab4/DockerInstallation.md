## Task 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose

1. I already had a docker on my machine but based on [This topic](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/video-analytics/1.0.0.0?topic=solution-installing-python-pip-docker-components) we should do the following:

- install python
- install pip
- install Docker
- install Docker Compose

2. Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350
   Docker Compose version 2.0.0-beta.4

3. I was installing Docker desktop version on windows and it required to install Hyper-V or WSL and it was hard to do since i was beginner in this stuff. Later on it was hard to make it work stable, since while starting containers there is an error about not having enough memory.
