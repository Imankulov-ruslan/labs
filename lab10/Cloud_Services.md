# Cloud Services

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

### AWS Artifact Registries

AWS CodeArtifact is a service for storing and managing artifacts, while AWS Artifact is a compliance portal that provides access to AWS security and compliance reports.

### GCP Artifact Registries

GCP Artifact Registry is a centralized location where organizations can manage container images and language packages. It seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud's tools and runtimes and supports native artifact protocols.

### Azure Artifact Registries

Azure Artifact is a service that enables the creation and sharing of Maven, npm, NuGet, and Python package feeds from both public and private sources. These packages can be used in various development pipelines and tools such as Azure Pipelines, Team Foundation Server (TFS), Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps Server, and Jenkins.

### Differences between Artifact Registries

- AWS Artifact focuses primarily on providing compliance-related artifacts.
- GCP Artifact Registry is a fully managed service supporting Docker and Maven repositories. It integrates well with other GCP services and includes built-in vulnerability scanning for container images.
- Azure Artifacts is a package management service that supports multiple package types. It integrates well with Microsoft services like Azure DevOps and Visual Studio, offering features such as access control and feed management.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

### AWS Serverless Computing Platform

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without the need to provision or manage servers, handle cluster scaling logic, manage event integrations, or maintain runtimes.

### GCP Serverless Computing Platform

Google Cloud Functions is an environment for serverless execution, enabling the building and connection of cloud services. By writing simple, single-purpose functions, you can attach them to events emitted by your cloud infrastructure and services. These functions are triggered when the corresponding events occur, and they execute in a fully managed environment.

### Azure Serverless Computing Platform

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables the execution of event-triggered code without explicit infrastructure provisioning or management. Azure Functions supports triggers, which initiate code execution, and bindings, which simplify coding for input and output data.

### Differences between Serverless Computing Platforms

- AWS Lambda has the most advanced platform and a vast ecosystem of third-party tools and integrations.
- GCP Cloud Functions places a strong emphasis on event-driven computing and integrates well with other GCP services like Pub/Sub and Firestore. It also offers built-in support for popular Node.js frameworks.
- Azure Functions boasts strong integration with other Microsoft services such as Azure Event Grid and Azure Cosmos DB.
